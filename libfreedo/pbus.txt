The PBUS (player bus) is not at all well documented. There exists
the patent WO09410636A1 "PLAYER BUS APPARATUS AND METHOD" which was
filed on 1992-02-11. The primary details of the protocol can be
found in pages 21 - 23.

> Since the above described arrangement permits 448 bits to be
> transferred per field and the minimum bit transfer per device is
> 8bits, a maximum of approximately 56 devices can be on the bus at
> one time.
>
> Each of the player devices has an ID code embedded in its response
> data. An ID code is mapped by software in the system to the number
> of input and output bits for the device identified. Since the ID
> code is embedded, it is received by the system 100 both at
> initialization and when data is being read in under normal
> operation. In this manner, it is possible to reconfigure the
> system (add or delete devices) without re-initializing and without
> adversely affecting those device already on the line.
>
> During an initialization sequence, a string of zeros is shifted
> out from the system 100. A requirement for all of the player
> devices is that they see a string of zeros either as an
> initialization or don't cares.
>
> The first 4 bits of data stream received by the system 100 from
> each device is that device's basic identification code (ID
> code). The embedding of an ID code in the data stream functions as
> follows for a joystick 15. The basic joystick 15 will have 8 bits
> of data that are (inverted): down, up, right, left, switch-2,
> switch-1, fire-2 and fire-1. Using the inability of the joystick
> to indicate both up and down at the same time, the ID codes for a
> basic joystick are 01QQ, 10QQ and 11QQ, where QQ is 01, 10 or
> 11. All other devices start with 00QQ. All joysticks are incapable
> of generating 00 for their first 2 bits. With regard to the escape
> function, the 1100 sequence indicates escape for the joystick. In
> all other devices, the escape function is indicated by the bit
> immediately following the 4 bit identification code. A string of
> zeros indicate the end of input data into the system 100 device.

However, information from the original FreeDO release does not seem
to match with the specifics of the patent.

MOUSE:

The mouse appears to use 32bits.

* 8bit: identifier (0x49)
* 1bit: left button
* 1bit: middle button
* 1bit: right button
* 1bit: shift button
* 10bit: X delta (signed)
* 10bit: Y delta (signed)

JOYPAD:

The joypad's data layout is clear but less so in regards to it's
layout in the stream. The identifier seems necessary but other
values work (3DO's SDK indicates the ID is 0x80 but FreeDO was using
0x48). Perhaps the ID is really a mask and really the 'connectivity'
bit. It's not clear from the 3DO SDK event.h file what the raw data
layout is.

8bit: 0x00
8bit: identifier (0x80)
2bit: unknown / unused
1bit: left trigger
1bit: right trigger
1bit: X
1bit: P
1bit: C
1bit: B
1bit: A
1bit: left
1bit: right
1bit: up
1bit: down
2bit: unknown / unused
1bit: connectivity?

LIGHTGUN:

x = 0 - 639
y = 0 - 240
offset = (((y * 794.386) + x) / 5.0)

8bit: identifier (0x4D)
1bit: trigger
1bit: service button (arcade shooters)
1bit: coin button (arcade shooters)
1bit: start (arcade shooters)
1bit: holster (arcade shooters) / option (retail)
1bit: unused?
1bit: unused?
17bit: screen offset

It's not clear where '794.386' or '5.0' are derived from. Also, unlike
the mouse, when placed twice in a buffer it doesn't get picked up as
1p and 2p. One instance shows up as player 2.

To reload in Mad Dog II requires "shooting off screen" which appears
to be represented as y = 0 and x = ~20 - ~640.
